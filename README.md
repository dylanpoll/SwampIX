SwampHacks Project Repo

this project is used to generate cards for a card game.

game mechanics :
    attack -> damage dealt when attacking or defending
    defense -> used to ward off attack damage, anything below this does not affect the cards health. defence is restored after each attack resolves.
    health -> overflow damage dealt after defence deductions lowers this value until death
    death damage -> when this creature dies, deals this much damage to the owning player or player commanders health.

    the game will use lanes
    you can sack a turn to re arrange your creatures lane positions
    and from the first turn till the 4th turn a new lane is added starting from 1 
    maybe make all creatures do death damage equal to their casting cost +2 

    energy is spent to play cards in equal to their casting cost.
    you start energy out at 1 and increase only on the death of your creatures. like if you have a creature die then your vessel for energy increases by 1 allowing you to attempt to play cards with a higher casting cost.
    
    Death dammage is dammage dealt to you directly when a card you have in play dies.

    I think that combo that with death damage and it would make things a bit interesting as you want to play bigger cards but can only do that if you have creatures die
